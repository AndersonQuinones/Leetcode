# LeetCode Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems. My goal is to create a habit of solving problems every day to enhance my coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Folder Structure

- Each problem solution is organized in its own folder, named after the problem's ID and title.

Inside each folder, you'll find the solution file(s) and any supporting files if necessary. Here are some additional details:
  
- `solution.ts`: This file contains my solution to the specific problem. The code is written in Python.
- `supporting_file1.ts`, etc.: These files are supporting files that may contain helper functions, data structures, or any additional code required for the solution.

I have included the problem's ID and title in the folder name to make it easy to navigate and locate the solutions for a specific problem. The LeetCode ID helps in identifying and searching for the problem on the LeetCode platform.

By organizing my solutions in this manner, I can maintain a clean and structured repository, making it convenient to review and share my code with others.

Please note that the solutions provided are my own interpretations and may not be the only or the most optimal solutions for the given problems. I continuously strive to improve my coding skills, and I welcome any feedback or alternative solutions that may enhance the overall quality of the repository.

Happy coding!
